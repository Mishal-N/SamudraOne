# **App Name**: SamudraOne Platform

## Core Features:

- Data Ingestion and Management: Ingest and manage oceanographic, fisheries, and biodiversity data from multiple sources using an API and data upload interfaces. Clean and standardize collected data.
- AI-Powered Fish Stock Prediction: Predict potential fishing zones based on SST (sea surface temperature) and catch data, using an LSTM model to assist with decision-making as a tool to incorporate factors influencing migration and spawning patterns into its outputs.
- Biodiversity Classification: Employ CNN-based classification for species and otolith morphology to categorize and analyze marine biodiversity data.
- Interactive Map-Based Dashboard: Create an interactive map-based dashboard for real-time data visualization, incorporating time-series visualization for dynamic data analysis.
- eDNA Species Identification: Implement ML-based genetic sequence matching for species identification using eDNA samples, enabling comprehensive biodiversity assessment.
- Role-Based Access Control: Implement role-based access control for fishermen, researchers, and policymakers, securing data accessibility based on user roles.
- Taxonomy Resolution: Provide access to WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species) and OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System) APIs for taxonomy resolution.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep ocean blue (#1A535C) to evoke a sense of the marine environment.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#E8F0F2) to provide a calm, neutral backdrop that highlights the data visualizations.
- Accent color: Seafoam green (#4ECDC4) for interactive elements and key data points to draw attention and indicate activity.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will provide a modern and clean look for the platform.
- Use consistent, simple, and modern icons to represent different data types, tools, and functionalities in the platform.
- Design a responsive, grid-based layout that ensures data is well-organized and easily accessible across various screen sizes.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement, like loading states and data updates, to create a dynamic user experience.
